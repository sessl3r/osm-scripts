# OSM Scripts

This repository contains some very basic helper scripts to map trees into OSM.
Those scripts are really not high quality or good tested, just what I used.

## osm.py

Helper class and functions to communicate with OSM API


## create-changeset.py

Create a new changeset. This changesetid is needed for most other scripts.

## create-tree.py

Script to create a tree object in OSM depending on a JPG image with GPS informations.

## update-osm-node.py

Mainly used to add missing tags to the trees created earlier.
